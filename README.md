## Introduction

NeoChat is a client for [Matrix](https://matrix.org), the decentralized communication protocol for instant
messaging.

NeoChat is based on KDE frameworks and as [libQuotient](https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient), a
Qt-based SDK for the [Matrix Protocol](https://spec.matrix.org/).

## Features

NeoChat aims to be a fully featured application for the Matrix specification. As such most parts of the current specification are supported, with the notable exceptions
of VoIP, threads, and some aspects of End-to-End Encryption. There are a few other smaller omissions due to the fact that the Matrix spec is constantly
evolving, but the aim remains to provide eventual support for the entire spec.

Due to the nature of the Matrix specification development NeoChat also supports numerous unstable features. Currently these are:
- Polls - MSC3381
- Sticker Packs - MSC2545
- Location Events - MSC3488

## Get it

Details where to find stable releases for NeoChat can be found on its [homepage](https://apps.kde.org/neochat).

Nightly builds for Linux and Windows can be downloaded from [cdn.kde.org](https://cdn.kde.org/ci-builds/network/neochat/).
Nightly builds for Android are available from [KDE's nightly F-Droid repository](https://community.kde.org/Android/F-Droid).
Nightly Flatpaks are available from [KDE's nightly Flatpak repository](https://userbase.kde.org/Tutorials/Flatpak).

## Building NeoChat

The best way to build KDE apps during development is to use `kdesrc-build`. The full instructions for this can be found on
the KDE community website's get involved section under [development](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development). This
is primarily aimed at Linux development.

For Windows and Android [Craft](https://invent.kde.org/packaging/craft) is the primary choice. There are guides for setting up
development environments for [Windows](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development/Windows) and [Android](https://develop.kde.org/docs/packaging/android/building_applications/).

## Running

Just start the executable in your preferred way - either from the build directory or from the installed location.

## Tests

Tests are in the repository under [autotests](autotests) and [appiumtests](appiumtests).

The project has CI setup to test new commits to the repository. All tests are expected to pass for a merge request to
be complete.

## Current build status

![coverage](https://invent.kde.org/network/neochat/badges/master/pipeline.svg)

Currently the number of tests is limited, but growing. If anyone wants to help improve this, those
contributions would be especially welcome.

## Contributing

As is the case throughout the KDE ecosystem contributions are welcome from all. The code base is managed in the
[NeoChat repository](https://invent.kde.org/network/neochat) of the KDE Gitlab instance.
